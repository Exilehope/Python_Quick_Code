'''
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
'''
'''
I define function go, which will return the sum x for x in a range of 1-1000, if x is equal to zero when divided by 3 or 5. Then it will print out the function to the user.

def go():
	return(sum([x for x in range(1000) if x%3==0 or x%5==0]))
print (go())

#Validation - number should be 233168
